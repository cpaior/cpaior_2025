      title: Breaking the Symmetries of Indistinguishable Objects
      speaker: Özgür Akgün, Mun See Chang, Ian P. Gent, Christopher Jefferson
      doi: https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-95973-8_10
      abstract: Indistinguishable objects often occur when modelling problems in constraint
        programming, as well as in other related paradigms. They occur when objects
        can be viewed as being drawn from a set of unlabelled objects, and the only
        operation allowed on them is equality testing. For example, the golfers in
        the social golfer problem are indistinguishable. If we do label the golfers,
        then any relabelling of the golfers in one solution gives another valid solution.
        In this paper, we show how we can break the symmetries resulting from indistinguishable
        objects. We show how these symmetries induce symmetries of types built from
        indistinguishable objects, for example in a matrix indexed by indistinguishable
        objects. We then show how the resulting symmetries can be broken correctly
        and completely. As the method can be prohibitively expensive, we also study
        methods for breaking the symmetry only partially. In Essence , a high-level
        modelling language, indistinguishable objects are encapsulated in ‘unnamed
        types’. We provide an implementation to automatically break symmetries of
        unnamed types.

      title: Breaking Symmetries from a Set-Covering Perspective
      speaker: Michael Codish, Mikolas Janota
      doi: https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-95973-8_11
      abstract: We formalize symmetry breaking as a set-covering problem. For the
        case of breaking symmetries on graphs, a permutation covers a graph if applying
        it to the graph yields a smaller graph in a given order. Canonical graphs
        are those that cannot be made smaller by any permutation. A complete symmetry
        break is then a set of permutations that covers all non-canonical graphs.
        A complete symmetry break with a minimal number of permutations can be obtained
        by solving an optimal set-covering problem. The challenge is in the sizes
        of the corresponding set-covering problems and in how these can be tamed.
        The set-covering perspective on symmetry breaking opens up a range of new
        opportunities deriving from decades of studies on both precise and approximate
        techniques for this problem. Application of our approach leads to optimal
        LexLeader symmetry breaks for graphs of order \(n\le 10\) as well as to partial
        symmetry breaks which improve on the state-of-the-art.

      title: Acquiring and Selecting Implied Constraints with an Application to the
        BinSeq and Partition Global Constraints
      speaker: Jovial Cheukam Ngouonou, Ramiz Gindullin, Claude-Guy Quimper, Nicloas
        Beldiceanu, Rémi Douence
      doi: https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-95976-9_10
      abstract: We propose a machine-assisted approach to synthesise implied constraints
        for global constraints based on combinatorial objects. By reusing the Bound
        Seeker (BS) [ 8 ], we generate thousands of relationships between features.
        We present a scalable algorithm that automatically selects the relationships
        that filter the most, which we manually prove. We consider the Partition and
        the BinSeq constraints, which model the different ways of dividing a collection
        of objects into clusters, or the repartition of shifts in a 0–1 sequence.
        We use Partition and BinSeq in the Balanced Academic Curriculum Problem (BACP),
        and the Balanced Shift-Scheduling Problem (BSSP), where we optimise the distribution
        of the work to balance the workload. For 2 models of the BACP and 2 models
        of the BSSP, we show how the filtering inferred by the BS improves the cost
        of the solution found on different solvers. This filtering proved optimality
        for all CSPLib instances of the BACP.

      abstract: This presentation explores the integration of machine learning into constraint programming (CP) to build the next generation of neuro-symbolic solvers. It highlights how learning-based techniques—such as reinforcement learning and graph neural networks—can enhance search heuristics and propagation strategies. The presentation also examines recent advances in leveraging Lagrangian relaxation and decomposition methods through learning to strengthen dual bounds and improve solver efficiency. Finally, it explores how AI can be used to enhance the art of modelling in CP, and it discusses the many challenges of combining artificial intelligence and logical reasoning to enhance the power, adaptability, and scalability of combinatorial optimization.

      title: Optimized Scheduling of Medical Appointment Sequences using Constraint
        Programming
      speaker: George Assaf, Sven Löffler, Petra Hofstedt
      doi: https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-95973-8_1
      abstract: We propose a novel constraint-based model to efficiently tackle the
        medical appointment sequence scheduling problem (MASSP), inspired by a real-world
        problem at Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin . In many practical medical
        scenarios, scheduling a sequence of appointments, rather than a single appointment,
        has become increasingly essential for patients undergoing multi-stage treatments.
        The goal of the MASSP is to identify a set of medical resources with sufficient,
        consecutive, and available time slots in their calendars to create a sequence
        of appointments for effectively managing a treatment plan. The problem comprises
        various constraints, including the availability of both the intended patient
        and required medical resources, as well as the time and resource dependencies
        among the individual appointments that constitute the sequence. To address
        this, we formulate the problem as a constraint optimization problem ( \(\mathcal
        {COP}\) ) that not only captures the basic constraints of the MASSP but also
        optimizes resource assignment to ensure a fair workload distribution within
        the medical facility. The results of our experiments demonstrate that the
        model performs effectively under diverse conditions, which confirms the utility
        and robustness of the proposed model in optimizing resource allocation and
        ensuring equitable workload distribution.

      title: An integrated optimisation method for aluminium hot rolling
      speaker: Ioannis Avgerinos, Apostolos Besis, Ioannis Mourtos, Athanasios Psarros,
        Stavros Vatikiotis, Georgios Zois
      doi: https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-95973-8_2
      abstract: This paper addresses the scheduling of aluminium slabs in a hot rolling
        mill, which is a critical stage in aluminium rolling. Hot rolling defines
        a challenging variant of flowshop scheduling because of multiple side constraints
        imposed by quality specifications plus the need for synchronization with the
        preceding stage where slabs are preheated in furnaces. An additional complication
        arises from the objective of minimizing succession penalties in the rolling
        mill, in order to maximise roll quality. Current practices group slabs into
        batches and then schedule batches to reduce succession penalties and avoid
        idle times during the transition from preheating to hot rolling. Motivated
        by the operational requirements of a leading EU manufacturer of aluminium
        rolled products, we propose a novel approach that replaces the conventional
        batching approach by treating each aluminium slab individually. The aim is
        to expand the range of potential successions in the hot rolling mill and thus
        further reduce the sum of succession penalties. To formalise a set of elaborate
        (hard and soft) constraints, we introduce a Mixed Integer Linear Programming
        model for both the hot rolling and assignment of slabs to furnaces, and a
        Constraint Programming model for the precise schedule computation of each
        slab. These models are optimised sequentially to obtain a schedule (a ‘production
        cycle’) given a set of available slabs. Experiments on real inventory data
        demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces the total succession
        penalties, while avoiding idle times between preheating and rolling. Therefore,
        our study could enhance production planning and scheduling for aluminium rolling.

      title: Reducing Income Variability in Natural Resource Portfolios via Integer
        Programming
      speaker: Laura Greenstreet, Qinru Shi, Marc Grimson, Franz W. Simon, Suresh
        A. Sethi, Carla P. Gomes, Andrea Lodi, David B. Shmoys
      doi: https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-95976-9_2
      abstract: Alaskan fishing communities are heavily impacted by income variability,
        where studies suggest benefits to individuals and communities through diversification
        by participating in multiple fisheries. However, Alaska uses a limited entry
        permit system, allowing only a fixed number of individuals to participate
        in each fishery. This motivates a resource allocation problem to determine
        how to allocate fishing permits to minimize a global measure of income variability.
        Further, experts and policy makers are interested in what interventions are
        most effective for enabling diversification. In collaboration with Alaskan
        fisheries experts, we developed a quadratic constrained resource allocation
        problem to reduce community-level income variability and model financial and
        vocational training interventions. Using over 20 years of fisheries data,
        we demonstrate an integer programming approach can solve instances up to the
        state level, involving over 10,000 permits and 170 communities. The model
        shows the potential for a 30–75% reduction in community-level average fishery
        income variance and provides a flexible framework for resource managers to
        explore the impacts of financial and vocational training interventions to
        support natural resource portfolio adaptation.

      title: Reinforcement Learning-based Heuristics to Guide Domain-Independent Dynamic
        Programming
      speaker: Minori Narita, Ryo Kuroiwa, J. Christopher Beck
      doi: https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-95976-9_9
      abstract: 'Domain-Independent Dynamic Programming (DIDP) is a state-space search
        paradigm based on dynamic programming for combinatorial optimization. In its
        current implementation, DIDP guides the search using user-defined dual bounds.
        Reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly being applied to combinatorial
        optimization problems and shares several key structures with DP, being represented
        by the Bellman equation and state-based transition systems. We propose using
        reinforcement learning to obtain a heuristic function to guide the search
        in DIDP. We develop two RL-based guidance approaches: value-based guidance
        using Deep Q-Networks and policy-based guidance using Proximal Policy Optimization.
        Our experiments indicate that RL-based guidance significantly outperforms
        standard DIDP and problem-specific greedy heuristics with the same number
        of node expansions. Further, despite longer node evaluation times, RL guidance
        achieves better run-time performance than standard DIDP on three of four benchmark
        domains.'

      title: Shaping Reward Signals in Reinforcement Learning Using Constraint Programming
      speaker: Chao Yin, Quentin Cappart, Gilles Pesant
      doi: https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-95976-9_16
      abstract: Reinforcement learning is a machine learning paradigm in which an
        agent learns through interaction a policy, that is what sequence of actions
        to take in some environment in order to maximize the reward it receives. Reward
        shaping modifies the reward function in an attempt to accelerate agent training.
        Under some conditions, potential-based reward shaping ( pbrs ) preserves the
        optimal policies of the original problem. We propose a pbrs method that automatically
        derives shaped rewards from a constraint programming ( cp ) model of the environment
        and from the probability mass functions over the domains of its variables,
        as provided by the cp bp framework. In the context of an ai planning task,
        we investigate the effect of cp modeling choices on the effectiveness of our
        reward shaping method. Our experiments show that our method significantly
        shortens training while being rather insensitive to modeling choices, and
        that the resulting agent’s performance scales well beyond instance sizes seen
        during training.

      title: Learning Primal Heuristics for 0-1 Knapsack Interdiction Problems
      speaker: Luca Ferrarini, Stefano Gualandi, Letizia Moro, Axel Parmentier
      doi: https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-95973-8_14
      abstract: 'In interdiction problems, two opposing decision-makers act sequentially:
        the leader plays first by selecting items to restrict the choices of the follower,
        while the follower selects those that maximize her profit from the remaining
        items. In knapsack interdiction, both decision-makers face different budget
        constraints. We propose a heuristic based on a single-level approximation
        of the leader-follower problem that we interpret as a combinatorial optimization
        layer in a machine learning pipeline. The ML pipeline includes a Generalized
        Linear Model as the first layer, which predicts the parameters of the single-level
        problem. Using a perturbation approach, we regularize the single-level problem,
        which enables to make it differentiable and provides a natural loss to train
        the model. Once trained, the pipeline provides effective ordering heuristics
        to solve Knapsack Interdiction problems. Extensive computational results on
        benchmarks from the literature show that the learned ML-based primal heuristics
        are extremely fast and compute solutions with a small optimality gap.'

      title: Self-Supervised Penalty-Based Learning for Robust Constrained Optimization
      speaker: Wyame Benslimane, Paul Grigas
      doi: https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-95973-8_7
      abstract: 'We propose a new methodology for parameterized constrained robust
        optimization, an important class of optimization problems under uncertainty,
        based on learning with a self-supervised penalty-based loss function. Whereas
        supervised learning requires pre-solved instances for training, our approach
        leverages a custom loss function derived from the exact penalty method in
        optimization to learn an approximation, typically defined by a neural network
        model, of the parameterized optimal solution mapping. Additionally, we adapt
        our approach to robust constrained combinatorial optimization problems by
        incorporating a surrogate linear cost over mixed integer domains, and a smooth
        approximations thereof, into the final layer of the network architecture.
        We perform computational experiments to test our approach on three different
        applications: multidimensional knapsack with continuous variables, combinatorial
        multidimensional knapsack with discrete variables, and an inventory management
        problem. Our results demonstrate that our self-supervised approach is able
        to effectively learn neural network approximations whose inference time is
        significantly smaller than the computation time of traditional solvers for
        this class of robust optimization problems. Furthermore, our results demonstrate
        that by varying the penalty parameter we are able to effectively balance the
        trade-off between sub-optimality and robust feasibility of the obtained solutions.'

        of Constellations
      speaker: Henoïk Willot, Jean-Loup Farges, Gauthier Picard, Philippe Pavero
      doi: https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-95976-9_15
      abstract: This paper addresses a new problem arising from the novel concept
        of multi-mission federation in Earth observation. This problem arises because
        of the development of several competing ground station networks that could
        be used by a component of federated missions called Satellite Communication
        and Resource Management System (SCRMS). Among the functions of SCRMS selection
        of contacts is a challenging decision problem. It is an optimization problem
        with Boolean variables corresponding to the selection of some contacts among
        potential contacts. Constraints enforce the fulfillment of the communication
        needs of the satellites. The considered criteria are the communication cost
        and the conflicts and jamming between satellites when communicating with sites,
        optimized lexicographically. We propose a linear program, several incomplete
        search schemes and greedy allocation schemes to address this problem, and
        evaluate them on realistic systems. Results indicate that the linear program
        complies with computation time requirements and produces better contact selection
        plans than other optimization schemes.

        Scheduling Problem

        Camps, Philippe Garnier, Emmanuel Hebrard, Pierre Lopez
      doi: https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-95976-9_11
      abstract: 'Effective scheduling of tasks for nanosatellites is essential, given
        their limited onboard resources and capabilities. In a typical nanosatellite
        mission, the onboard computer has to run payload tasks linked to the mission
        objective, such as observations and measurements for science campaigns, but
        also communication and avionic tasks needed for navigation and safety. We
        consider a partitioned real-time system where a partition is a job that embeds
        a set of elementary tasks implementing one of the above-described functions.
        The offline nanosatellite partition scheduling problem consists in scheduling
        a set of partitions on a singlecore processor within a fixed time frame that
        will be repeated cyclically, while maximizing the number and duration of scheduled
        payload partitions. The paper first establishes similarities and differences
        with related scheduling problems. We then prove that the problem is strongly
        NP-hard. A Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) matheuristic and a Constraint
        Programming (CP) model are proposed. We compare the MILP and CP approaches
        in a multi-objective context and demonstrate the relevance of the latter to
        solve the problem efficiently both on randomly generated instances and on
        a real nanosatellite case study of the University Space Center of Toulouse:
        the NIMPH project. The CP model is embedded in NanoSatScheduler, an open source
        software with a user interface designed for the offline nanosatellite partition
        scheduling problem. For the NIMPH real-case study, the proposed solution outperforms
        the semi-manual approach used so far. As a result, the NIMPH team has adopted
        NanoSatScheduler as an operational tool for their mission.'

      doi: https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-95973-8_5
      abstract: Planning the activities of an Earth observation satellite is a highly
        combinatorial task. It consists in regularly computing the sequence of observations
        to be performed by a satellite to collect images of candidate points of interest
        (POIs), while taking into account the time-dependent maneuvers required to
        point the satellite to the successive POIs. To solve such a recurrent optimization
        problem, we propose a novel approach that exploits offline learning techniques
        to approximate scheduling feasibility for sets of observation tasks. For this,
        we build a 0/1 neural network classifier whose inputs are related to the geographical
        positions of the POIs to be observed over the satellite orbit. We also learn
        hard capacity constraints limiting the number of observable POIs within orbit
        portions of various sizes. Finally, we introduce a hybrid algorithm, called
        HySSEO , optimizing the observation schedules based on a two-step process.
        The latter first searches for an optimal selection of POIs given the learned
        constraints, and then exploits this selection to bootstrap the search for
        an optimal schedule satisfying detailed time-dependent transition constraints.
        This hybrid optimization approach significantly improves the solution quality
        when compared to a standard scheduling approach.

      abstract: 'Novel Earth observing systems aim to leverage newly developed Uncrewed
        Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to provide higher resolution spatio-temporal data than
        is currently available through satellite, crewed flights, or in-situ sensors,

        data available from satellites and other sources to identify high value science

        uses a variant of the Orienteering Problem with time-dependent science reward

      abstract: Traditionally, SAT encodings of complex constraints, such as linear
        constraints or more specifically PB constraints, are specified in terms of
        Boolean variables and clauses. However, often sets of related Boolean variables
        are either encodings of integer variables, or act as if they were. Furthermore,
        any encoding of linear constraints has to encode partial sums, and these are
        integers (even if the encoding does not explicitly notice this). By formally
        specifying the SAT encoding using integer variables and constraints, coupled
        with a procedure to encode this specification into SAT, we can gain some more
        insight into the encoding methods, and compose new ones. Experiments using
        these integer-driven encodings show that they can improve on standard approaches
        to encoding PB and integer linear constraints to SAT.

      abstract: 'We investigate the effectiveness of splitting the search space in
        parallelising the state-of-the-art CP-SAT solver. One of the key barriers
        to effective search-space splitting in learning solvers is the generated sub-problems
        are not independent, leading to substantial communication-related overhead,
        substantial redundant work, or both. Our contributions attempt to mitigate
        this issue: job reassignment; and trail sharing. Jobs (sub-trees) are reassigned
        to new workers if the clause database of the currently assigned worker appears
        ill-suited to the region of the search-space, when doing so workers can share
        some of the state from their local trail. We argue a trail prefix can be viewed
        as a lossy compressed representation of much of the relevant information a
        worker has learnt about a job, this information can be exploited by the next
        worker assigned the same subtree to avoid some redundant work. We show these
        approaches complement standard portfolio and clause-sharing approaches, improving
        CP-SAT’s performance on MiniZinc challenge benchmarks with a moderate number
        of worker threads. To enable these approaches, we also introduce “Buffered
        Work Stealing,” which can be parameterised to emulate the two main existing
        approaches to search-space splitting in the literature: Work Stealing and
        Embarassingly Parallel Search, as well as an intermediate configuration between
        these two extremes that slightly outperforms both.'

      abstract: 'Most state-of-the-art branch-and-bound solvers for mixed-integer
        linear programming rely on limited-precision floating-point arithmetic and
        use numerical tolerances when reasoning about feasibility and optimality during
        their search. While the practical success of floating-point MIP solvers bears
        witness to their overall numerical robustness, it is well-known that numerically
        challenging input can lead them to produce incorrect results. Even when their
        final answer is correct, one critical question remains: Were the individual
        decisions taken during branch-and-bound justified, i.e., can they be verified
        in exact arithmetic? In this paper, we attempt a first such a posteriori analysis
        of a pure LP-based branch-and-bound solver by checking all intermediate decisions
        critical to the correctness of the result: accepting solutions as integer
        feasible, declaring the LP relaxation infeasible, and pruning subtrees as
        suboptimal. Our computational study in the academic MIP solver SCIP confirms
        the expectation that in the overwhelming majority of cases, all decisions
        are correct. When errors do occur on numerically challenging instances, they

        that would require further processing.'

        Compilation
      speaker: Andrea Balogh, Guillaume Escamocher, Barry O'Sullivan
      doi: https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-95973-8_3
      abstract: Knowledge compilation allows for quick retrieval of a wide variety
        of information about an instance of a constraint satisfaction problem or Boolean
        formula. Unfortunately, the compiled representation can be so large that it
        cannot be used in practical settings, especially when there are restrictions
        on the amount of available memory. It has been recently observed that assigning
        some carefully chosen variables can significantly reduce the size of the representation,
        with only a small loss of data about the instance. However determining how
        many, and which, variables should be assigned to create a compact compiled
        instance requires making a number of expensive computations, including completely
        compiling the full initial instance, which might not be achievable for large
        instances. Our work in this paper involves removing large compilations from
        the process of constructing selective backbones. First we look at how statistical
        properties of literals can be used as fast heuristics to pick which variable
        to assign next. Then we show how the behaviour of selective backbones for
        small instances can help determine the size at which selective backbones for
        large instances are expected to offer the best compromise between the quantity
        of knowledge lost and the amount of space saved. We also extend previous work
        to take into account weighted preferences on models. This is beneficial since
        various probabilistic models can be expressed in such terms.

      abstract: Mixed integer linear programming (MILP) solvers ship with a staggering
        number of parameters that are challenging to select a priori for all but expert
        optimization users, but can have an outsized impact on the performance of
        the MILP solver. Existing machine learning (ML) approaches to configure solvers
        require training ML models by solving thousands of related MILP instances,
        generalize poorly to new problem sizes, and often require implementing complex
        ML pipelines and custom solver interfaces that can be difficult to integrate
        into existing optimization workflows. In this paper, we introduce a new LLM-based
        framework to configure which cutting plane separators to use for a given MILP
        problem with little to no training data based on characteristics of the instance,
        such as a natural language description of the problem and the associated formulation.
        We augment these LLMs with descriptions of cutting plane separators available
        in a given solver, grounded by summarizing the existing research literature
        on separators. While individual solver configurations have a large variance
        in performance, we present a novel ensembling strategy that clusters and aggregates
        configurations to create a small portfolio of high-performing configurations.
        Our LLM-based methodology requires no custom solver interface, can find a
        high-performing configuration by solving only a small number of MILPs, and
        can generate the configuration with simple API calls that run in under a second.
        Numerical results show our approach is competitive with existing configuration
        approaches on a suite of classic combinatorial optimization problems and real-world
        datasets with only a fraction of the training data and computation time.

      abstract: Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILPs) are highly flexible and powerful
        tools for modeling and solving complex real-world combinatorial optimization
        problems. Recently, machine learning (ML)-guided approaches have demonstrated
        significant potential in improving MILP-solving efficiency. However, these
        methods typically rely on separate offline data collection and training processes,
        which limits their scalability and adaptability. This paper introduces the
        first multi-task learning framework for ML-guided MILP solving. The proposed
        framework provides MILP embeddings helpful in guiding MILP solving across
        solvers (e.g., Gurobi and SCIP) and across tasks (e.g., Branching and Solver
        configuration). Through extensive experiments on three widely used MILP benchmarks,
        we demonstrate that our multi-task learning model performs similarly to specialized
        models within the same distribution. Moreover, it significantly outperforms
        them in generalization across problem sizes and tasks.

      doi: https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-95976-9_14
      abstract: A standard tool for modelling real-world optimisation problems is
        mixed-integer programming (MIP). However, for many of these problems, information
        about the relationships between variables is either incomplete or highly complex,
        making it difficult or even impossible to model the problem directly. To overcome
        these hurdles, machine learning (ML) predictors are often used to represent
        these relationships and are then embedded in the MIP as surrogate models.
        Due to the large amount of available ML frameworks and the complexity of many
        ML predictors, formulating such predictors into MIPs is a highly non-trivial
        task. In this paper, we introduce PySCIPOpt-ML, an open-source tool for the
        automatic formulation and embedding of trained ML predictors into MIPs. By
        directly interfacing with a broad range of commonly used ML frameworks and
        an open-source MIP solver, PySCIPOpt-ML provides a way to easily integrate
        ML constraints into optimisation problems. Alongside PySCIPOpt-ML, we introduce
        SurrogateLIB, a library of MIP instances with embedded ML constraints, and
        present computational results over SurrogateLIB, providing intuition on the
        scale of ML predictors that can be practically embedded. The project is available

      speaker: Gaetano Signorelli, Michele Lombardi
      doi: https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-95976-9_13
      abstract: The problem of ensuring constraints satisfaction on the output of
        machine learning models is critical for many applications, especially in safety-critical
        domains. Modern approaches rely on penalty-based methods at training time,
        which do not guarantee to avoid constraints violations; or constraint-specific
        model architectures (e.g., for monotonocity); or on output projection, which
        requires to solve an optimization problem that might be computationally demanding.
        We present the Hypersherical Constrained Representation, a novel method to
        enforce constraints in the output space for convex and bounded feasibility
        regions (generalizable to star domains). Our method operates on a different
        representation system, where Euclidean coordinates are converted into hyperspherical
        coordinates relative to the constrained region, which can only inherently
        represent feasible points. Experiments on a synthetic and a real-world dataset
        show that our method has predictive performance comparable to the other approaches,
        can guarantee \(100\%\) constraint satisfaction, and has a minimal computational
        cost at inference time.

      abstract: The Test Laboratory Scheduling Problem (TLSP) is an NP-hard scheduling
        problem based on the real-world scheduling requirements of an industrial test
        laboratory. TLSP requires the solver to find a grouping of tasks into jobs,
        and to schedule those jobs, assigning resources of different types (employees,
        workbenches, and equipment) and optimizing different soft constraints. Over
        time, new real-world scheduling requirements have emerged that necessitate
        a more flexible description of resources. To deal with such situations, in
        this paper, we propose Generalized TLSP (G-TLSP), a new problem extension
        of TLSP which unifies different resource types. To solve G-TLSP, we propose
        a new Constraint Programming (CP) model and solve instances with exact CP
        solvers as well as with a Very Large Neighborhood Search (VLNS) algorithm.
        Our approaches are evaluated on existing instances as well as two new real-world
        instances. We achieve competitive performance with existing specialized solvers
        on converted TLSP instances and find high-quality solutions for the new real-world
        instances.

      abstract: Liquid-handling instruments are indispensable tools in modern biomedical
        laboratories, streamlining compound and sample management tasks with precision
        and efficiency. Compound dispensing from large chemical libraries divided
        over hundreds of microwell plates can require substantial swapping of plates,
        particularly if compounds from multiple source plates are to be dispensed
        in each destination plate. Despite robotisation, plate swapping is a time-consuming
        necessity for high-throughput experiments, posing a significant bottleneck.
        In this paper, we explore the application of constraint programming (CP) to
        the planning of liquid-handling tasks to minimise plate swaps in automated
        dispensing. We formulate the problem as a combination of a set partitioning
        problem and the construction of a bipartite network. We present six CP models
        implemented in MiniZinc and evaluate their performance on synthetic benchmarks
        using three state-of-the-art constraint solvers. This work highlights the
        potential of CP to enhance the scalability and efficiency of automated compound

        for the Job Sequencing and Tool Switching Problem (JS-TSP), a combinatorial
        optimization problem originating from manufacturing systems and encompassing
        the Traveling Salesman Problem as a special case. We propose a new family
        of lower bounds for the optimal solution to the problem, which are provably
        tighter than existing bounds in the literature and enhance both solution quality
        and pruning efficiency. We propose the use of A* and its anytime variants
        to explore the solution space of the problem as well as a specific data structure,
        called FreeTools , both to keep track of the state information and to compute
        incremental costs throughout the implicit search efficiently. Extensive computational

      abstract: 'In public transit, the multi-depot electric vehicle scheduling problem
        (MDEVSP) involves assigning a fleet of electric buses to a set of timetabled
        trips while addressing constraints related to battery recharging. A common
        approach to solving this problem leverages column generation, wherein a master
        problem identifies a base solution, and subproblems generate additional schedules
        to enhance it. These subproblems are often modeled as shortest path problems
        on a graph, where nodes represent trips and potential recharging opportunities.
        Prior works have used time-space networks with dynamic selection of recharging
        opportunities. However, this network type introduces practical limitations,
        such as the inability to enforce ad-hoc constraints on trip sequences. Recently,
        Gerbaux et al. (2025) proposed a machine-learning-based method to accelerate
        the resolution of the subproblems by heuristically reducing their size. While
        effective, this approach raises concerns in industrial applications, including
        data privacy for customers and compliance with legal regulations. In this
        context, we propose a novel approach to model the subproblems within a column-generation-based
        algorithm for the MDEVSP. Our contributions are as follows: (1) A new graph
        formulation that preselects recharging opportunities, offering greater flexibility
        in trip assignment and enabling the integration of ad-hoc constraints; (2)
        A constructive meta-heuristic, based on a greedy randomized adaptive search
        procedure , to reduce the subproblem size without relying on machine learning
        or historical data; (3) Additional pruning rules to further reduce the subproblem
        size. Experimental results, conducted on hundreds of realistic instances derived
        from real bus lines in Montreal, show that our approach achieves comparable
        performance to the state-of-the-art method by Gerbaux et al. (2025), while
        avoiding the use of machine learning.'

        Routing with a Distribution Objective

      abstract: In this paper we focus on a challenging version of the aircraft maintenance
        routing problem (AMRP) with a maintenance distribution objective (AMRP-D).
        For the AMRP-D, the flight legs with predefined start and end times are assigned
        to aircraft. In addition to the assigned flight legs, each aircraft has to
        satisfy certain regulations regarding the maintenance services that are mandatory
        in the scheduling period, while the maintenance should also be distributed
        evenly. We propose a two stage approach, where first we use a decomposition
        method that is solved using constraint programming, to cover the flight legs.
        To optimize the distribution objective, we propose two metaheuristic techniques
        based on Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) and Simulated Annealing (SA). The
        LNS method consists of different destroy operators and as repairer we use
        a constraint programming (CP) solver. The SA approach includes a novel neighborhood
        to deal with the distribution objective. Our experimental results show that
        the decomposition method is able to solve more instances than the exact approach,
        while SA provides better quality solutions for the optimization stage compared
        to LNS.

        (QAH) has expanded opportunities for research into quantum annealing-based
        algorithms. In the domain of power systems, this advancement has driven increased
        interest in applying such algorithms to mixed-integer problems (MIP) like
        Unit Commitment (UC). UC focuses on minimizing power generator operating costs
        while adhering to physical system constraints. Grid operators solve UC instances
        daily to meet power demand and ensure safe grid operations. This work presents
        a novel hybrid algorithm that leverages quantum and classical computing to
        solve UC more efficiently. We introduce a novel Benders-cut generation technique
        for UC, thereby enhancing cut quality, reducing expensive quantum-classical
        hardware interactions, and lowering qubit requirements. Additionally, we incorporate
        a k -local neighborhood search technique as a recovery step to ensure a higher
        quality solution than current QAH alone can achieve. The proposed algorithm,
        QC4UC, is evaluated on a modified instance of the IEEE RTS-96 test system.
        Results from both a simulated annealer and real QAH are compared, demonstrating
        the effectiveness of this algorithm in reducing qubit requirements and producing
        near-optimal solutions on noisy QAH.

      title: Accelerated Discovery of Set Cover Solutions via Graph Neural Networks
      speaker: Zohair Shafi, Benjamin A. Miller, Tina Eliassi-Rad, Rajmonda S. Caceres
      doi: https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-95976-9_12
      abstract: Machine learning (ML) approaches are increasingly being used to accelerate
        combinatorial optimization (CO) problems. We investigate the Set Cover Problem
        (SCP) and propose Graph-SCP, a graph neural network method that augments existing
        optimization solvers by learning to identify a smaller sub-problem that contains
        the solution space. Graph-SCP uses both supervised learning from prior solved
        instances and unsupervised learning to minimize the SCP objective. We evaluate
        the performance of Graph-SCP on synthetically weighted and unweighted SCP
        instances with diverse problem characteristics and complexities, and on instances
        from the OR Library, a canonical benchmark for SCP. We show that Graph-SCP
        reduces the problem size by 60–80% and achieves runtime speedups of up to
        10x on average when compared to Gurobi (a state-of-the-art commercial solver),
        while maintaining solution quality. This is in contrast to fast greedy solutions
        that significantly compromise solution quality to achieve guaranteed polynomial
        runtime. We showcase Graph-SCP’s ability to generalize to larger problem sizes,
        training on SCP instances with up to 3,000 subsets and testing on SCP instances
        with up to 10,000 subsets.

      title: On the Efficiency of Algebraic Simplex Algorithms for Solving MDPs
      speaker: Dibyangshu Mukherjee, Shivaram Kalyanakrishnan
      doi: https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-95976-9_8
      abstract: 'Markov Decision Problems (MDPs) are a widely-used abstraction of
        sequential decision-making. A policy specifies an action to take from each
        state of the MDP. Every MDP has an optimal policy, which maximises the expected
        long-term reward from each starting state. A well-known approach to compute
        an optimal policy for a given MDP is by solving an induced Linear Program
        (LP). This paper establishes the computational efficiency of a family of “Algebraic
        Simplex” (AS) algorithms for solving these induced LPs. Unlike geometric methods
        that rely on quantities such as “value”, “gain”, or “flux”, AS algorithms
        query policies sequentially for the discrete set of locally-improving state-action
        pairs. We provide upper bounds on the complexity of AS algorithms in three
        settings: (1) when there are many more states than actions, (2) when there
        are many more actions than states, and (3) when transitions are deterministic.
        For all three cases, we furnish AS algorithms with running-time upper bounds
        that are within a polynomial factor of the tightest known yet across all algorithms.
        These results demonstrate that the use of geometric information and random
        access memory do not contribute substantively to the established efficiency
        of state-of-the-art algorithms.'

      title: Bounded-Error Policy Optimization for Mixed Discrete-Continuous MDPs
        via Constraint Generation in Nonlinear Programming
      speaker: Michael Gimelfarb, Ayal Taitler, Scott Sanner
      doi: https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-95973-8_15
      abstract: We propose the Constraint-Generation Policy Optimization (CGPO) framework
        to optimize policy parameters within compact and interpretable policy classes
        for mixed discrete-continuous Markov Decision Processes (DC-MDP). CGPO can
        not only provide bounded policy error guarantees over an infinite range of
        initial states for many DC-MDPs with expressive nonlinear dynamics, but it
        can also provably derive optimal policies in cases where it terminates with
        zero error. Furthermore, CGPO can generate worst-case state trajectories to
        diagnose policy deficiencies and provide counterfactual explanations of optimal
        actions. To achieve such results, CGPO proposes a bilevel mixed-integer nonlinear
        optimization framework for optimizing policies in defined expressivity classes
        (e.g. piecewise linear) and reduces it to an optimal constraint generation
        methodology that adversarially generates worst-case state trajectories. Furthermore,
        leveraging modern nonlinear optimizers, CGPO can obtain solutions with bounded
        optimality gap guarantees. We handle stochastic transitions through chance
        constraints, providing high-probability performance guarantees. We also present
        a roadmap for understanding the computational complexities of different expressivity
        classes of policy, reward, and transition dynamics. We experimentally demonstrate
        the applicability of CGPO across various domains, including inventory control,
        management of a water reservoir system, and physics control. In summary, CGPO
        provides structured, compact and explainable policies with bounded performance
        guarantees, enabling worst-case scenario generation and counterfactual policy
        diagnostics.

      abstract: 'Proper parameter configuration of algorithms is essential, but often
        time-consuming and complex, as many parameters need to be tuned simultaneously
        and evaluation can be expensive. In this paper, we focus on sequential decision-making
        (SDM) algorithms, which are applied to problems that require a series of decisions
        to be taken sequentially, aiming for an optimal cumulative outcome for the
        agent. To do this, every time the agent needs to make a decision, SDM algorithms
        take the current state of the environment as input and provide a decision
        as output. We propose a taxonomy of algorithm configuration approaches for
        SDM and introduce the concept of Per-State Algorithm Configuration (PSAC).
        To perform PSAC automatically, we present a framework based on Reinforcement
        Learning (RL). We demonstrate how PSAC by RL works in practice by applying
        it to two SDM algorithms on two SDM problems: Monte Carlo Tree Search, to
        solve a collaborative order picking problem in warehouses, and AlphaZero,
        to play a classic board game called Connect Four. Our experiments show that,
        in both use cases, PSAC achieves significant performance improvements compared
        to fixed parameter configurations. In general, our work expands the field
        of automated algorithm configuration and opens new possibilities for further
        research on SDM algorithms and their applications. Code is available at: https://github.com/ai-for-decision-making-tue/Per-State_Algorithm_Configuration
